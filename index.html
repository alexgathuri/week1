        <b>Hire purchase system</b>
        <a href="https://alexgathuri.github.io/Hire-purchase-system/">LINK IS HERE</a><br>
            This is a system which I did as my Final year project in strathmore.<br>
            This system deals with selling products on the market on a hire purchase. <br>
            It was designed for the company KCT (Kenya Creddit traders)
             where I did my internship. <br>
            It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.
            <br><br>
            
        <b>Stock management system</b> 
        <a href="https://alexgathuri.github.io/Hire-purchase-system/">LINK IS HERE</a><br>
            This system was designed to manage and keep track of products within 
            a children's home (Thomas Barnados) 
            <br>since one of the problems 
            they had was keeping track of their products. <br>
            It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.
            <br><br>
        
        <b>Hospital managment system</b> 
        <a href="https://alexgathuri.github.io/Hire-purchase-system/">LINK IS HERE</a>
        <br>
            This system was designed to manage patient
             queues within southb Mariakani hospital. <br>
            They did not have a system which enabled patients to 
            know how long they will wait in queues.<br>
             It was also designed for keeping track of patient appointments.<br>
             It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.

            </div>
    <p>
        
I completed my Degree at Strathmore University having pursued 
a bachelorâ€™s Degree in Business in Information Technology (BBIT)
 and graduated in June 2019. 
I've worked at Unclaimed Financial 
Assets Authority for 3 months. My active involvement in this certain 
career field has done so well in developing my communication,
 analytical, organizational and leadership skills, which are vital
  in finding success in the corporate world.
I therefore wish to expand my knowledge, skills and commitment at
 Moringa school. I believe I can learn alot at Moringa School since
  I have a passion in programing. It is my interest to put into practice 
  the knowledge that I will aquire in a work site in future.
