    <p><b>Projects that i have created.</b><br>
        -Hire purchase system (https://github.com/alexgathuri/proj.git)<br>
            This is a system which I did as my Final year project in strathmore.<br>
            This system deals with selling products on the market on a hire purchase. <br>
            It was designed for the company KCT (Kenya Creddit traders) where I did my internship. <br>
            It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.<br><br>
            
        -Stock management system (https://github.com/alexgathuri/proj.git)<br>
            This system was designed to manage and keep track of products within a children's home (Thomas Barnados) since one of the problems they had was keeping track of their products. <br>
            It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.<br><br>
        
        -Hospital managment system (https://github.com/alexgathuri/proj.git)<br>
            This system was designed to manage patient queues within southb Mariakani hospital. <br>
            They did not have a system which enabled patients to know how long they will wait in queues.<br>
             It was also designed for keeping track of patient appointments.<br>
             It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.<br>
