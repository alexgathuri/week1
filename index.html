    <p><b>Projects that i have created.</b><br>
        -Hire purchase system (https://github.com/alexgathuri/proj.git)<br>
            This is a system which I did as my Final year project in strathmore.<br>
            This system deals with selling products on the market on a hire purchase. <br>
            It was designed for the company KCT (Kenya Creddit traders) where I did my internship. <br>
            It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.<br><br>
            
        -Stock management system (https://github.com/alexgathuri/proj.git)<br>
            This system was designed to manage and keep track of products within a children's home (Thomas Barnados) since one of the problems they had was keeping track of their products. <br>
            It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.<br><br>
        
        -Hospital managment system (https://github.com/alexgathuri/proj.git)<br>
            This system was designed to manage patient queues within southb Mariakani hospital. <br>
            They did not have a system which enabled patients to know how long they will wait in queues.<br>
             It was also designed for keeping track of patient appointments.<br>
             It was designed with PHP, HTML AND CSS.<br>

    <li> <a><b>About me</b></a>
    <p>
        
I completed my Degree at Strathmore University having pursued a bachelorâ€™s Degree in Business in Information Technology (BBIT) and graduated in June 2019. 

I've worked at Unclaimend Financial Assets Authority for 3 months. My active involvement in this certain career field has done so well in developing my communication, analytical, organizational and leadership skills, which are vital in finding success in the corporate world. 

I therefore wish to expand my knowledge, skills and commitment at Moringa school. I believe I can learn alot at Moringa School since I have a passion in programing. It is my interest to put into practice the knowledge that i will aquire in a work site in future.
<br><br>
<b>Hobbies</b><br>
I like travelling and exploring new places.<br>
I enjoy outdoor sport activities such as swimming and football.<br>
I play chess as a leisure activity.<br>
